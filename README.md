# EXP-1 – PROMPT ENGINEERING
## Aim

To develop a comprehensive report explaining the fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), covering foundational concepts, architectures (such as Transformers), real-world applications, and the impact of scaling laws in modern LLMs.

## Output
### 1. Fundamentals of Generative AI

Generative AI refers to machine learning systems capable of producing new content—text, images, music, or code—based on patterns learned from training data.
Key ideas include:

Representation learning

Probability modeling

Pattern synthesis

Zero-shot and few-shot generalization

These systems create outputs that are not copied but generated through learned relationships.

### 2. Generative AI Architecture (Transformers)

The Transformer architecture is the backbone of modern LLMs. Its key mechanisms are:

Self-Attention: Helps the model understand relationships between words regardless of distance.

Encoder-Decoder Layers: Enable mapping input sequences to meaningful representations.

Parallel Processing: Allows faster training than older models like RNNs and LSTMs.

Transformers support extremely large models such as GPT, PaLM, LLaMA, and Gemini.

### 3. Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI is widely applied in:

Content creation (articles, images, videos)

Chatbots and virtual assistants

Software code generation

Data analysis and summarization

Healthcare (drug discovery, diagnosis aids)

Finance (risk modeling, forecasting)

Education (automated tutoring, adaptive learning)

Its versatility makes it one of the most impactful technologies today.

### 4. Impact of Scaling in LLMs

Scaling refers to increasing:

Model parameters

Dataset size

Training compute

Results of scaling include:

Higher accuracy

Better reasoning ability

Improved language comprehension

Stronger generalization

Emergence of new abilities (few-shot learning, complex problem solving)

LLMs become more powerful as they grow, but also more expensive to train and maintain.
